1) Initialize GLFW with glfwInit()

2) glfWindowHint lets you set options to configure. What are these?

3) glfwCreateWindow() function creates a window.
    Args:
        Width
        height
        Title
        ?
        ?
    Returns:
        NULL upon failure.

4) glfwMakeContextCurrent()
    Makes the specified window current on the calling thread.
    Each thread can only have one current context, 
    and each context can be made current on only one thread.

5) Use glViewPort() to tell OpenGL the dimensions of rendering window.
    The first two parameters of glViewport set the location of the lower 
    left corner of the window. The third and fourth parameter set the width 
    and height of the rendering window in pixels, which we set equal to GLFW's 
    window size.
